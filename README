NAME

    Excel::Reader::XLSX - Read data from an Excel 2007+/XLSX format file.

DESCRIPTION

    Excel::Reader::XLSX is a fast and lightweight parser for Excel 2007+
    XLSX files.

    use Excel::Reader::XLSX;

    my $reader   = Excel::Reader::XLSX->new();
    my $workbook = $reader->read_file( 'Book1.xlsx' );

    if ( !defined $workbook ) {
        die $reader->error(), "\n";
    }

    for my $worksheet ( $workbook->worksheets() ) {

        my $sheetname = $worksheet->name();

        print "Sheet = $sheetname\n";

        while ( my $row = $worksheet->next_row() ) {

            while ( my $cell = $row->next_cell() ) {

                my $row   = $cell->row();
                my $col   = $cell->col();
                my $value = $cell->value();

                print "  Cell ($row, $col) = $value\n";
            }
        }
    }
